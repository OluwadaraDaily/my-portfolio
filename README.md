# My Portfolio Website

This is a solution to the [Single-page developer portfolio](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/singlepage-developer-portfolio-bBVj2ZPi-x/hub). I seized the opportunity to create my own portfolio website.

## My process

I started work with the mobile section first. I divided up the page into sections and I built them in different `views`. As such, the logic, responsiveness and data for each section is separated from every one.
This is the first time I am trying this and seems to work well for a single page app.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Vuelidate](https://vuelidate-next.netlify.app/) - A Vue Form Handler
- [Airtable API](https://airtable.com/developers/web) - Save form data submissions

### What I learned

I learned the following:

- Vuelidate. I learned how to use this library for this project.
- Vue3. I have used Vue2 for most of my life.

### Useful resources

- [Vuelidate](https://learnvue.co/articles/intro-to-vuelidate#using-vuelidate-with-the-composition-api) - This helped me to learn Vuelidate quickly.
- [Posting HTML form data to Airtable via REST API](https://blog.devgenius.io/html-form-to-airtable-via-api-fc2f6f743cef) - This helped me learn integrating with Airtable.
